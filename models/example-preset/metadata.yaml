# VALIDATION & NOTES
# ============================================================================

validated: false
# Has this preset been tested and validated on independent samples?
# Set to true only after proper validation

validation_notes: ""
# Results of validation testing
# Example: "Tested on 5 independent samples. 15% improvement in protein IDs compared to default models. RT prediction R² = 0.95"

notes: |
  Add detailed notes about:
  - Training conditions (sample types, preparation)
  - Expected performance improvements
  - Recommended use cases
  - Any known limitations or special considerations

  Example:
  Models trained on HeLa digest samples using 30 SPD method.
  Optimized for high-throughput proteomics applications.
  Best suited for mammalian proteomes with similar complexity.

  Performance metrics:
  - Average precursor IDs: +12% vs default
  - RT prediction accuracy: R² = 0.94
  - Library size: ~2.5M precursors (human proteome)
